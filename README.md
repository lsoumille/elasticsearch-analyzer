# Elasticsearch-Analyzer
Elasticsearch Cortex analyzer implementation

### Use Case

Make Elasticsearch queries from extracted observables

### Done
* JSON configuration file
* Analyzer skeleton
* Elasticsearch functions
* Cortex input integration
* Support several Elasticsearch hosts to query
* Observable as query argument
* Template writing
* Elasticsearch query tuning (aggregations, based on timestamp...)

### To Be Tested
* Add proxy support
* Add Certificate verification

### To Be Done
* Make new flavors

## How to make a new flavor
* Clone this repository
* Install python requirement (pip install -r requirements.txt)
* Add execution right to python script (chmod +x elasticsearch_analyzer.py)
* Copy paste Elasticsearch_base.json.template to Elasticsearch_NAME.json
* Fulfill Elasticsearch_NAME.json, replace XXXX vy values that are matching your environment
* Add Elasticsearch_NAME as name value
* Add your name as author value
* Add your Elasticsearch Query (make always an aggregation for matching TheHive template output)
* Add observable types on which users will launch your analyzer
* DO NOT CHANGE baseConfig and service
* Optional : Update Cortex configuration in order to use your own analyzers if it's already done
* Restart Cortex
* Make the analyzer configuration (set up ES URL, authentication settings ...)
* Upload the template in TheHive
* Analyze ! should be working
